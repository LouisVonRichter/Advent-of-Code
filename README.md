<h1> Advent of Code </h1>

  <p>Currently all of my code for the 2019/2020 year is in python. I eventually plan to revisit it in other languages as a way to boost my skills and learn new approaches to the problems.</p>

<h2> What is Advent of Code </h2>

  <p><a href="http://was.tl/">Eric Wastl</a>, the creator of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> challenge describes it as: <br  />
    <blockquote>"An Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other." </blockquote></p>
